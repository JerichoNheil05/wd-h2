            <p> Disgust is a basic human emotion characterized by 
                a strong feeling of aversion or repulsion towards 
                certain stimuli, which can be either physical, such 
                as unpleasant smells, tastes, and sights, or psychological, 
                such as immoral behavior. It serves an evolutionary purpose
                by helping individuals avoid harmful substances and situations 
                that might pose a threat to health and well-being. Disgust is 
                often accompanied by physical reactions like nausea, gagging, or 
                facial expressions of revulsion, and it plays a significant role 
                in social and moral judgments, influencing how people perceive 
                and respond to others' actions.</p>
